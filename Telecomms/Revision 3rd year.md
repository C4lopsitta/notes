## Tension
Tension is the difference in potential between the two electrical terminals. (V)
## Current
Current is the flux of power between the two electrical terminals. (I)
## Power
Power is calculated as follows
$$
W = V * Q

$$
or across time:
$$
\frac{W}{t} = \frac{V*Q}{t}
$$
so considering that $P = \frac{W}{t}$:
$$
P = V * \frac{Q}{t} = V * I
$$
So concluding:
$$
[W] = [V][A]
$$
## Pointed charges
To simplify calculations, let's consider only charges that are applying pressure in the same direction.
### Applying the theory
Let's imagine a Wire, in the middle of that wire we have a point. From this point we apply tension, from the two sides we will get either a positive or a negative charge flux called $Q_(direction)^(charge)$.
So the charge *Q* can be calculated by using the following formula:
$$
|delta Q| = |Q_r^+| - |Q_r^-| - |Q_r^+| + |Q_l^-|
$$
$$
\frac{deltaQ}{t}
$$
To calculate the charge correctly we need a minimal time, almost zero, so we use the derivate of delta Q:
$$
\lim_{t->0} \frac{delta Q}{t} idontfuckingknowfuckingshit
$$
## Coulomb's Law
Two charges with the same charge (+/-) represented by $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ have a $F$ force vector that is constant and pushes the two charges away from eachother.
This force is calculated by:
$$
F = K \cdot \frac{Q_1 \cdot Q_2}{r^2}
$$
### Example
$Q_1$ is fixed in place and around it there are $n$ charges of the same charge (positive for example). From $Q_1$ there are $n$ vectors pushing away each and every charge away from $Q_1$.
### Example 2
The charge $Q_2$ with a repulsion force of $r$ from $Q_1$ needs to move from point $A$ to point $B$ and this movement pushes $Q_2$ closer to $Q_1$. To complete this movement we need to give $Q_2$ enough energy, whose total is unknown (can be both positive and negative), to complete the movement. We will call this energy $W_2$. The energy will vary depending on the charge's closeness to the $Q_1$ charge because the closer it needs to get the more energy it needs in the positive way, while when the charge has to move further back the energy given has to be negative so as to pull back the $Q_2$ charge from $Q_1$.
$$
\frac{W_1}{Q_1} = \frac{W_2}{Q_2} = V
$$
The ratio between the energy and the charge is equal to the *potential*. 
For example if we give 3 Joules and  2 Coulombs:
$$
\frac{3J}{2c} = \frac{1.5J}{1c}
$$
So in conclusion:
$$
V_{AB}=V_A-V_B
$$
in a generic bi pole device with current flowing from $B$ to $A$. So $V_{BA}=-V_{AB}$.
