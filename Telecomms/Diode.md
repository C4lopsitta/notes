\begin{cases}
\omega = \frac{rad}{s} \\
f(x): y=x \cdot sin(\omega t)
\end{cases}

The *amplitude* is the maximum value that the $sin$ can assume. It's $1$ but it can be multiplied with $x$.
The *period* is the length from a crest to another on the same side.
The *frequency* is $\frac{1}{T}$ and it measures how many times the wave repeats in a specified amount of time.
$\omega$ can be calculated by multiplying the period which is $2\pi$ by the frequency:
$$
\omega = 2\pi \cdot f

# The Diode

## Calculating the resistance for a LED
$$
R >= \frac{5V - 2V}{(16mA\space to\space 32mA)}
$$
Because the A changes depending on the color of the led. Usually on *thinkercad* is *20mA* and it's the current limit.
