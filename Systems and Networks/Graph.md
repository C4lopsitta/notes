# Graph
A graph is a series of nodes connected together. There are multiple types of graphs and the lines that connect the nodes are called "arcs".
A generic graph $G$ is formed by $V$ vertices and $E$ arcs, so $G(V, E)$.
It can also be ordered if the arcs have a direction, sorta like a list.
## Weighted graphs
A weight can be associated to each arc. This can help indicate a cost of crossing that arc.
