# Objects
Objects are like "boxes" that contain **methods** and **attributes**, which are equivalent to functions and variables. These are accessible only through the object and are invisible to the outside if they aren't accessed through accessor methods or from the class if public.
## Information hiding
In Object Oriented Programming each and every class can be hidden and not be visible by the end user of the class-library and only use the methods that are publicly accessible from the outside. Nothing about the implementation will be visible from the outside.
## The UML diagram
The UML Diagram, or **Unified Modelling Language**, represents one or more classes and their relation. [^1]
> [!TODO] Add the mermaid diagram based on the following table
```mermaid

```

| **Shape** |
| ----- |
| - lenght : int |
| + getLenght() : int <br> + setLenght(n : int) : void |

The first element on the top is the Class name, followed by the attributes and finally by the accessor accompanied by each parameter and relative types of returns and parameters.
